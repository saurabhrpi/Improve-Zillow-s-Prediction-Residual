Build a model to improve the Zestimate residual error

Zillow’s Zestimate home valuation has shaken up the U.S. real estate industry since first released 11 years ago. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property. And, by continually improving the median margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today), Zillow has since become established as one of the largest, most trusted marketplaces for real estate information in the U.S. and a leading example of impactful machine learning. In this project, taken up from the Kaggle competition : "Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)" the idea is to improve the Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log error and the actual log error. The log error is defined as logerror=log(Zestimate)−log(SalePrice)
